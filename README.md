# Vahan Vehicle Registration Analysis Project

A comprehensive solution for scraping, analyzing, and visualizing vehicle registration data from the Vahan portal.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser (for web scraping)
- Git (for version control)

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/trufurs/Vahan_Scraping_educational.git
cd Vahan_Scraping_educational

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# For Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# For Unix/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# For Scraper
cd "vahan scraper"
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Dashboard
pip install streamlit pandas plotly sqlite3
```

### 3. Chrome WebDriver Setup
- Download ChromeDriver matching your Chrome version
- Place the executable in the `vahan scraper` directory
- Or add to system PATH

### 4. Database Setup
```bash
# For scraped data
python exceltodb.py

# For Excel data
cd "../vahan dashboard with excel data"
python create_database_v2.py
```

### 5. Running the Dashboard
```bash
cd "../vahan scraper"
streamlit run dashboard_v2.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Data Assumptions

### 1. Data Structure
- Vehicle categories are predefined (2W, 3W, 4W)
- Each category has subcategories:
  ```
  2W: 2WN (Non-Transport), 2WT (Transport)
  3W: 3WN (Non-Transport), 3WT (Transport)
  4W: LMV, MMV, HMV
  ```
- Manufacturers are consistently named across periods
- Timestamps follow YYYY-MM format

### 2. Data Quality
- No duplicate entries for same vehicle/month
- Non-negative registration numbers
- No missing values in critical fields
- Month names are in uppercase (JAN, FEB, etc.)

### 3. Time Series
- Monthly data is sequential
- No gaps in monthly data
- Years are complete (all 12 months)
- Latest data is current year

### 4. Database
- SQLite database for storage
- Single database file per dataset
- Tables maintain referential integrity
- Backup files are maintained
